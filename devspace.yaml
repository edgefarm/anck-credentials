  # `dev.ports` specifies all ports that should be forwarded while `devspace dev` is running
  # Port-forwarding lets you access your application via localhost on your local machine
  ports:
    - imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
      forward:
        - port: 6000
        - port: 23450
          remotePort: 2345
  # `dev.sync` configures a file sync between our Pods in k8s and your local project files
  sync:
    - imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
      excludePaths:
        - .git/
  # `dev.terminal` tells DevSpace to open a terminal as a last step during `devspace dev`
  terminal:
    imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
    # With this optional `command` we can tell DevSpace to run a script when opening the terminal
    # This is often useful to display help info for new users or perform initial tasks (e.g. installing dependencies)
    # DevSpace has generated an example ./devspace_start.sh file in your local project - Feel free to customize it!
    command:
      - bash

  # Since our Helm charts and manifests deployments are often optimized for production,
  # DevSpace let's you swap out Pods dynamically to get a better dev environment
  replacePods:
    - imageSelector: ${IMAGE} # Select the Pod that runs our `${IMAGE}`
      # Since the `${IMAGE}` used to start our main application pod may be distroless or not have any dev tooling, let's replace it with a dev-optimized image
      # DevSpace provides a sample image here but you can use any image for your specific needs
      replaceImage: loftsh/go:latest
      # Besides replacing the container image, let's also apply some patches to the `spec` of our Pod
      # We are overwriting `command` + `args` for the first container in our selected Pod, so it starts with `sleep 9999999`
      # Using `sleep 9999999` as PID 1 (instead of the regular ENTRYPOINT), allows you to start the application manually
